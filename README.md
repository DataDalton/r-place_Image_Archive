# r/Place Image Archive

The goal of the r/Place Image Archive is to provide a single place for every picture which is considered a 'final canvas' in r/Place

We also want to be able to provide every quality for each variation so that everyone can use what they want to use

There is no singular 'final canvas' as everyone thinks there's different points in time on the canvas which are final

Each folder will have the specific details for the images in it, such as if it is 10k x 10k 600 PPI or if it is 15k x 10k 600 PPI, or any other variation


This was originally in the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-uaPRUi2_NO6slTmdWGUIPbId8vsLNdW?usp=drive_link) however has been migrated to GitHub to better serve the community.

The Google Drive will still server as a mirror
